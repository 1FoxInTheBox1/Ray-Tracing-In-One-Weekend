This is an implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing In One Weekend written in c++. It directly copies many of the code samples provided in that book. For more info on the book, check out Peter Shirley's blog here: https://in1weekend.blogspot.com/

I will likely attempt to modify and extend this project once I have completed the book, however I'd just like to get it working for now!
