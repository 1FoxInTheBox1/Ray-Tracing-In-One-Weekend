This is an implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing In One Weekend written in c++. Much of the code is made of samples provided in that book. For more info on the book, check out the book's website here: https://raytracing.github.io/

Since completing the book, I have managed to implement albedo textures and the rendering of triangles.
stb_image was used to load images. You can learn more about it here: https://github.com/nothings/stb

I also implemented Bounding Volume Hierarchies, although I don't think they're implemented very well. Sebastian Lague's video on BVHs was very helpful on understanding what I needed to implement. You can find his video here: https://youtu.be/C1H4zIiCOaI?si=xsbomGzPqVNimBCh
