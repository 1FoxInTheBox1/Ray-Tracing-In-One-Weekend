This is an implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing In One Weekend written in c++. Much of the code is made of samples provided in that book. For more info on the book, check out the book's website here: https://raytracing.github.io/

Since completing the book, I have implemented many additional features including:
- Drawing of triangles
- Bounding volume hierachies
- Multi-threading
- Transformations on meshes
- Loading of albedo textures from images

Some renders from the completed project:
