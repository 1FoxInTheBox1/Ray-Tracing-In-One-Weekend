This is an implementation of Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing In One Weekend written in c++. It directly copies many of the code samples provided in that book. For more info on the book, check out the book's website here: https://raytracing.github.io/

Since completing the book, I have managed to implement textures. See the third image below to see it in action.
stb_image was used to load images. You can learn more about it here: https://github.com/nothings/stb

Some renders from the completed project:
